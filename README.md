# 🚀 Loan Applicant Demographics & Risk Analysis Insights Using Power BI + MSSQL + Gateway 📊💳

I'm excited to share a Loan Risk & Behavior Analysis Dashboard I developed using Power BI, SQL Server, and On-Premises Data Gateway. This project goes beyond charts—it's a real-time decision-support tool built for financial insight and automation.

🔍 What does this dashboard tell?

It visualizes key borrower data to understand:

Who is taking the largest loans (by credit score, employment type, age, etc.)

What purposes drive the most loans (home, education, business)

Which segments have the highest default rates

How trends have changed year-over-year in both loans and defaults


💡 Why this matters:

 In lending, one wrong approval can cost lakhs. Financial teams need more than Excel—they need a clear, updated, and automated view of loan risk. This dashboard helps:
 
 ✅ Detect risky loan segments
 
 ✅ Identify patterns in default behavior
 
 ✅ Understand borrower profiles in depth


📈 Key Insights Uncovered:

Borrowers with lower credit scores take higher median loans—a red flag for risk.

2016 saw the highest default rate at 11.75%, while 2017 showed recovery.

Unemployed and part-time individuals default more, while full-time earners take safer loans.

Single & divorced applicants show similar loan behavior to high-credit categories.


🔄 Why use the On-Premises Data Gateway?

 My data was stored locally in MS SQL Server—but I wanted my Power BI dashboard on the cloud to update automatically.
 
 That’s where On-Premise Gateway came in:
 
 🔗 Bridges local SQL data to Power BI Service
 
 🕒 Enables scheduled refresh & live reports
 
 🔒 Maintains secure, encrypted connections


🧰 Tools & Tech Used:

 ✔ Power BI
 
 ✔ MS SQL Server

 ✔ On-Premises Data Gateway
 
 ✔ DAX
 
 ✔ Data Modeling & Storytelling
 
📊 This project sharpened my skills in real-time analytics, secure data connection, and visual storytelling—all while solving a real business problem.

💬 Curious how to turn raw data into real decisions? I’d love to hear your thoughts.
